    "Detecting flares from periodic star signals is fuzzy business. We want to be able to notice a specific kind of a random signal of a roughly known shape, from the background of a slowly varying periodic signal that we might not fully know. On top of this, the data can be quite noisy.\n",

    "([doi:10.1038/nature11063](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11063#Sec2), Supplementary material) uses a technique where the differences between each pair of consecutive datapoints is recorded. This distribution is analyzed to find the 1st percentile of the data. Then, 3 times the 1st percentile (typically 0.1% the brightness of the star) is the threshold for picking up a superflare -> about 10 times more energy than the most energetic solar flares observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the technique removes the \"long-term brightness variation\" from the flare signal -> estimate the duration of the flare. The flare end time is when the excess flux falls below the threshold again; if it ends too early, there are too few datapoints.\n",

    "I got the idea that you could analyze flares by just looking at the linear (or polynomial) trend T0 in a rolling ~30-50 sample window. In the window, you would also look at a shorter 2-5 sample trend T. If T is sufficiently steep compared to T0, you would register that as a flare."
